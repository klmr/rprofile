# rprofile

<span class="pkg">rprofile</span> stream-lines project `.Rprofile` configuration loading.

## Installation

<span class="pkg">rprofile</span> is on CRAN. Install it via

```r
install.packages('rprofile')
```

## Usage

To use the package, add the following as the first line in a project `.Rprofile` file:

```r
if (requireNamespace("rprofile", quietly = TRUE)) rprofile::load()
```

In most cases, thatâ€™s it. See the documentation for available parameters to customize the configuration.

At the moment, <span class="pkg">rprofile</span> performs the following actions, in order, unless disabled via arguments:

1. If the project is using an <span class="pkg">renv</span> environment, it will be activated.
2. If the project contains a `.env` file in its current path, the environment variables it contains will be loaded via `readRenviron()`.
3. The user profile (that is, the file `~/.Rprofile`, or a file set via the `R_PROFILE_USER` environment variable) is loaded. Any errors that occur while loading this file will be converted into warnings, and `rprofile::load()` will invisibly return whether the file loaded without errors.
4. If the project is an R package, load it via `pkgload::load_all(export_all = FALSE)`. To avoid disrupting the regular package load order, this action will be deferred until after all default packages (given by `getOption('defaultPackages')`) have been loaded and attached.
